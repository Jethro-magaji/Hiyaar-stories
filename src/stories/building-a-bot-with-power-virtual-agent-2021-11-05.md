### Power Virtual Agents
Power Virtual Agents is part of the Microsoft Power Platform. It allows you to create intelligent bots easily and quickly to help guide your customers, employees, users, or viewers of your website. Compared to the traditional hand-coded computer programming, Power Virtual Agents provides a low-code/no-code development environment. 

The Power Virtual Agents platform is user-friendly with no real infrastructure to maintain in terms of deployment. Thus, making Power Virtual Agents a powerful, low code Chatbot engine. 

Sounds exciting right? Let's build a simple Pan Macmillan bot! Pan Macmillan is a book recommendation assistant owned by Pan Macmillan Publishing.

#### Let’s build a bot
 To get started, go to the Power Virtual Agent website and sign up for an account. If you don't have a license, that’s alright. A free trial is available on the website to get you started.


### 1. Creating  a new bot:
#### a.  At the top-right, click the robot icon, then “New bot.”



##### b. The ‘Create a new bot’ dialog box pops up. 



##### c.Enter a name for your bot along with a language and environment of choice.

#### 2. Create some topics: 



##### a. Click on ‘Topic’ at the left-hand navigation pane.


##### b. Click on a new topic and give your topic a name; ‘Novel suggestion’


##### c. Next, we need to create trigger phrases; here you give words or phrases your users will most likely use. Power Virtual Agents’ natural language capacity uses these trigger phrases to understand the intent of your users.
