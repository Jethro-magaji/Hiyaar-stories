 For a career in technology, one cannot just fill an application form, attend an interview session, and expect to get a job that many are competing for.
To look appealing to tech companies and enjoy the benefits of this high-paying, innovating, and exciting industry, being intentional is a must. This translates to greater work efficiency, faster promotions or career advancement, and of course, high earnings.

The amount of intention one brings to the tech table would determine how prepared the person is for opportunities and challenges, and how balanced and inspired they would be in the workplace. The tech world is too big and dynamic to leave one’s career to chance.

#### Why one should be intentional about a career in technology

Most times people rush into the Tech industry with the belief that since it is overpopulated, they can surely find their niche and be successful without making efforts. This ideology works for some, but for others, it becomes a lifelong work surrounded by burnout, purposelessness, and eventually a poor career track record.

 Mapping one's career in line with values, vision, short-term and long-term goals, and even personality would ensure that one does not simply float - but instead dominate the area where they belong.

The following tips will aid anyone to learn how to design, visualize and act to create an intentional career in tech and enjoy all the goodies that come with it.

### 1. Be intentional about choosing a career path

This step involves getting clear about what you want from the desired job, knowing your desired destination, understanding how your priorities, propose, and drive in life align with what you want, and finally, comprehending the field or working pattern that suits you perfectly.

The tech industry has many areas, niches, and room for advancement in career - so the first step to having a successful time in tech is to determine the path that is in line with your short- and long-term life goals, and then understand how you can play a role in that industry. Because it is not just enough to have a talent or have an interest, one needs to know how they can impact the industry and vice versa.

 This decision-making process of carving out a career path is one of the most overlooked but highly essential steps in taking a career in technology.

### 2. Be intentional about learning and gaining experience

After one has successfully drafted out a career path that would be beneficial and in line with goals and aspirations; the next step is learning, harnessing skills, and gaining more experience. The Tech industry is so remarkable that one can take advantage of free and low-cost resources, efficient networking platforms, seminars, workshops, and boot camps to increase one's skills and capability in the chosen niche.

In addition to learning the necessary skills associated with the path chosen, developing soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and collaboration is also very important. To effectively benefit from any training or teaching, one must ensure continuous practice, grab opportunities for real-life experience, and most importantly, never stop learning.

### 3. Be intentional about mentorship and building a professional network

The world today is filled with many efficient collaboration and communication platforms for individuals in tech to seek advice, build and develop a professional network and practice regular reflection. 
The importance of a mentor and a professional network cannot be overemphasized as these are the people who would guide, direct and make the path chosen smoother.

Although the tech industry is constantly growing, there is always the foundational aspect that should be obtained preferably from a mentor or an effective network. Bear in mind, however, that the wrong network or mentor can misguide a person into making wrong choices. I'm still stagnant in one's career, so being intentional about one’s network and mentor is not only a piece of advice but a warning.

### CONCLUSION

Reflection, constant practice, and a growth mindset are other areas to be intentional about for a great tech career. One can never go wrong with being deliberate about a tech career, but a lack of concrete intentions can lead to wasted years or even deprive one of the opportunity to kick start a career in tech.
