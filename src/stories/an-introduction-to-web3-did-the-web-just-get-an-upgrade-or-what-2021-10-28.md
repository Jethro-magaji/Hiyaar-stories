### Introduction

If this is what you had in mind when you heard of web3, then you should know you are not alone in this. I too pondered that I will be your guide to explaining the details behind web3. If you have no prior technical knowledge or you have a lot, this article is for you. At the end of this article, you can proudly engage in a web3 discussion without feeling lost in it. For context, Web1 is the same thing as Web 1.0.

### When was there even a Web 1.0 or Web 2.0?

Surprisingly, the web as we all know it has taken a lot of changes since it was first launched to the public in [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). The term Web 2.0 became a thing in the year 1991 thanks to [Darcy DiNucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_DiNucci). The leaps in technological upgrades on the web marked the differences between them to the recorded. 

Static HTML dominated the Web 1.0 period; there was no responsiveness, and files had to be kept on the server's disc, which prevented the use of relational databases and other advanced features.

The web as we know it now is Web 2.0. The rise of social media websites, which allowed individuals to share and connect on the internet, was a defining feature of the period. Users' experience is becoming a top consideration for website owners. On the web, complex data may now be analyzed and managed.



### The rise of Web 3.0

Well, to be honest, there isn’t a straightforward answer to when Web3 started because it’s more of a concept/theory in work than an implemented upgrade. We are all aware of the rise in the adoption of decentralized products by people, the most famous being Cryptocurrency which runs on Blockchain Technology. 

### What does Web3 promise?

We are well aware of the growing worry about the privacy of all of the data created by individuals on the internet, particularly in the Web2 age. Big tech corporations (as well as small tech companies) have complete control over how consumers' data is gathered, kept, and used. Web3 gives consumers complete ownership over their data, which is kept on the blockchain protocol rather than in a single database (controlled by IT corporations).

It also eliminates the necessity for a third party when people interact with one another over the internet. Due to the availability of [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) on the Blockchain, the system operates with little or no supervision. Typically, these third parties demand a fee for these services and more; however, Web3 provides users with free and more efficient online access.

“Security is an illusion” is a phrase most people in the tech space have heard. Despite this, Web3 promises to be more secure. Users’ data are protected on the blockchain network and they can decide to be anonymous for as long as they want.



### Conclusion

Same way cryptocurrency, a product of blockchain has been a revolutionary force in tech, Web3 hinges on that prospects by overcoming one of the fears of users by putting more control into their hands. For me, it has come to stay and although not everyone may adopt this “upgrade”, it is safe to say there’s a lot to achieve through Web3 and we are yet to scratch the surface.
