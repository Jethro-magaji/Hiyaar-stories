### Introduction

It’s, therefore necessary to plan a roadmap or process flow. This does not mean you have to have it all planned out at the start of it has to be top quality, a sketch will serve as a good starting point.

A wireframe is a skeletal blueprint of an application that establishes the flow of the application. It is a low-fidelity sketch that shows the main features of the application.
