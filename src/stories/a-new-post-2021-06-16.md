title: VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT
shortDesc: ' Variables are used to store data values. To use a variable in
  JavaScript, you must either use var, let, or  const. Developing a variable in
  JavaScript is referred to as "declaring" a variable. They are essential ideas
  in any programming language'

 ### INTRODUCTION
 Variable simply means something that could vary. A variable can be one data type and be changed later to another data type.

We have what we call local and global variables. If a variable is used within a block or can be accessed with a specific part of the program, it is called a local variable because it can only be accessed within that block structure. Global variables can be accessed everywhere within the program.  In this article, I'll be writing more on variables. How to name, assign, declare, reassign variables, and more about it.


### NAMING A VARIABLE
    
Variable names are case-sensitive:  A uppercase and lower-case character aren't the same. Here is an Example; $firstname, $FIRSTNAME, $firstName. These are different. 
A variable name cannot contain spaces. If it is more than a word, we can use an underscore "_".  For example, the variable "$Year 2021" is not correct, rather use "$Year2021" or "$Year_2021" 
Variable names should only include numbers (9,50,4,2021), letters (Year, age, etc.), dollar sign ($), or underscore (_). 
Select a variable name in a way that defines the character. For example, a variable that holds a car value might be named $Toyota.
Don't use the variable name with just a single character, use more than one word to name variables.

RESERVED NAMES

There are some words in JavaScript, that cannot be used as variables, labels, or function names. The usage of these phrases causes bugs when loading the script. As a developer, is important you know these words. Some examples of the words are;

            null   package   private   protected public    return   char   boolean    byte
           abstract   case   const    argument   do    catch   break   char    else   enum
           float    for    function    goto    instanceof    if    new    static    this   in   delete
           fault   debugger   default   switch   this   public   short   synchronized   class
           implement   interface   volatile   import   void   final   throw   transient   with


DECLARING OF VARIABLE
To declare a variable means to create the variable. We can declare a variable in three specific ways, with the use of var, let, or const. A variable can be declared as a local or global variable.
Examples of declaring variable;
 var a; 
var car; 
var name; 
These are undefined variables that are declared but not assigned.
VAR: Var is a global variable; we can reassign and redeclare a variable when using "var". All values can be assigned using var.
var A = string;
var B = boolean;
var C = number

LET: You cannot redeclare a variable defined with let. Let is restricted to which ever scope it's declared.
Examples;
Let a;
let a = 2;
let a, b, c;
let a = 2, b = 20, c = 10;
Variables can be redeclared when using let, we cannot do that with var. We can say 
let x = 30; and
let x = 3; This is because x has been declared already.

CONST: We cannot reassign or redeclare a variable when using const, when declaring a const variable, it must be assigned. Const means constant, its value cannot be changed.

const x = 'girl';
const y = 0;
const z = 'car';
We can't say const x = 'girl'; and const x = 0;
The value of a const cannot be changed. 
const name = 'Emem';
name = 'Jimmy'; this will result to an error, you can't do this


            ASSIGNING A VARIABLE
We can assign a value to a variable while declaring or after declaring the variable. A variable can be declared without assigning it. You assign a variable using the "=" operator
Example var a = 50;

DATA TYPES
In JavaScript we have different data types namely; string, Boolean, number, undefined, null, object, symbol, biglnt. All except objects are primitive data types, object is a non-primitive data type. Object data type stores different collections of data, while primitive data stores a single data only.
Example of primitive data type;
var car = {
name: "Toyota";
model: "CRV5";
year: 2008;
config: "two doors"
}
STRING: Represents textual data, that is wrapped in a single or a double quote. Strings are used for storing text. The number of elements in the string is its length.
Examples 
"Hello World"
 "Honda"
NUMBER: This is an integer or a floating-point number. It can be written with or without decimals.
Examples;
let x = 20;
let y = 2e-1;
let z = 2.5;
BOOLEAN: It's any of these two values, which are; True or False.
Boolean (20<10); this will return False
Boolean (20>10); will return True
BIGLNT: In JavaScript data type, biglnt is an integer with arbitrary precision.
Examples;
3n
4566n
23768954093567146788864598n
UNDEFINED: This is a data type whose variable is not initialized or assigned.
Examples;
var j; // creates a variable but no value is assigned
console.log ("j's value is" j) log j's value is undefined
const car;
let b;
NULL: It denotes a null value, non-existent or invalid object
Example; let car = null;

SYMBOL: It is a data type whose instances are unique and immutable. Symbols are called atoms.
Example; let car = symbol ('Honda');
OBJECT: It is a key-value pair of collection of data 
Example;
let car = { 
name: "Toyota";
model: "Camry";
year: 2017
}
It is recommended not to assign undefined to a variable. Null is usually used to assign "unknown" or "empty" values to a variable.

REASSIGNING 
This simply means what has been declared and assigned again. 
Example; 
var a = 20; 
var a = 15;
You have re-assigned the value of A to another.

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
They are simply used in mathematical expression, performed on the number, and operates on two numbers. Operators can manipulate certain values. It assigns values to a variable and adds them together.
Example; let w =1000 +50;
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR: This operator ('=') assigns a value to a variable.
Example; 
let x =3;
ADDING OPERATOR: This simply adds numbers (+)
let a = 6; //Assigns the value 6 to a
let b = 2; // Assigns value b to 2
let c = a + b   //The value 8 to c (6+2)
DIVIDING OPERATORS: Divides the numbers (/)
let a = 6;
let b = 2;
let c = a / b;
MULTIPLYING OPERATORS: This multiplies the numbers (*)
let a = 6;
let b = 2;
let c = a * b;
There are other arithmetic operators like the Remainder (%), Incrementing (++), Decrementing (--), Exponentiation (**).

SUMMARY
In conclusion, we understand that variable stores a single data value that can be changed later. You can declare and assign it to any value using var. This article also explained how and rules on naming a variable. If you have come this far, reading and studying with this article. I believe you've gained more knowledge about variables in JavaScript.
